Coffee Day Global Limited is a Chikmagalur based company which grows coffee in its own estates of 1, 200 acres. [4] It is the largest producer of arabica beans in Asia exporting to various countries including USA, Europe and Japan.[5]
Original logo

Café Coffee Day was started as a retail restaurant arm of CGL in 1996.[6] The first CCD outlet was set up on July 11, 1996, at Brigade Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka. It rapidly expanded across various cities in India adding more stores with more than 1000 cafés open across the nation by 2011.

In 2010, it was announced that a consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts would invest ₹10 billion (US$150 million) in Coffee Day Resorts, owned by the company. The same year, the logo was changed to the current logo, which the company stated was to showcase the chain as a place to talk.This was done with major changes in the layout of the stores, including the addition of lounges and a total revamp of the interiors.
